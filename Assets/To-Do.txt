Things to do to complete development of Cornage, in order:
(When you're done with a task, add a ✓ in between the brackets.)

[✓] Create player GameObject and implement basic movement
[✓] Allow the player to shoot corn kernels at a fixed rate and speed by holding the mouse button down
[✓] Create enemy GameObject (specifically a Slime) that squishes and stretches, and also follows the player
[✓] Give corn kernels the ability to damage and defeat Slimes
[✓] Improve graphics for player and enemy
[✓] Add camera movement that always attaches itself to the player, meaning the player is always centered on-screen
[✓] Add tiled grass texture so player knows when the camera is moving
[✓] Add collision for the player
[✓] Add boundaries for the camera and the player
[✓] Make corn bullets despawn when they pass these boundaries
[✓] Update spawn positions of enemies to be outside play boundaries
[✓] Add Bucks: defeating a Slime is worth 5 Bucks
[✓] Add a quota for Bucks
[✓] Add time limit; within this time limit, the player must both survive and reach a certain number of Bucks, in order to clear the current wave and go to the next wave
[✓] Add progression of waves; the player's high score is the highest wave number they survived to
[] Update Slime spawn rate so that higher waves spawn more Slimes
[] Add tile-based dirt patches that the player can plant corn kernels on
[] Make patches store a kernel value that grows over time
[] Allow the player to harvest grown kernels, adding them to a corn ammo variable
[] Limit corn ammo; the player should start with only around 10 kernels
[] Allow player to sell kernels for 1 Buck apiece
[] Allow player to execute a special "Cornado" attack with the Shift key (either LShift or RShift), which spawns ten corn kernels that are spawned around the player and fire away from them; this repeats rapidly 10 times total, so the attack costs 100 kernels to execute
[] Allow the player to be hurt by slimes and KO'd (the player has three lives, which regenerate in between waves)
[] Add title screen, game over screen, music, and sound effects
