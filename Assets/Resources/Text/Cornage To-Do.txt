Things to do to complete development of Cornage, in order:
(When you're done with a task, add a ✓ in between the brackets.)

[✓] Create player GameObject and implement basic movement
[✓] Allow the player to shoot corn kernels at a fixed rate and speed by holding the mouse button down
[✓] Create enemy GameObject (specifically a Slime) that squishes and stretches, and also follows the player
[✓] Give corn kernels the ability to damage and defeat Slimes
[✓] Improve graphics for player and enemy
[✓] Add camera movement that always attaches itself to the player, meaning the player is always centered on-screen
[✓] Add tiled grass texture so player knows when the camera is moving
[✓] Add collision for the player
[✓] Add boundaries for the camera and the player
[✓] Make corn bullets despawn when they pass these boundaries
[✓] Update spawn positions of enemies to be outside play boundaries
[✓] Add Bucks: defeating a Slime is worth 5 Bucks
[✓] Add a quota for Bucks
[✓] Add time limit; within this time limit, the player must both survive and reach a certain number of Bucks, in order to clear the current wave and go to the next wave
[✓] Add progression of waves; the player's high score is the highest wave number they survived to
[✓] Remove friction from players and enemies, and change their movement code to use FixedUpdate()
[✓] Add day and night cycle (slimes spawn during the night)
[✓] Update Slime spawn rate so that higher waves spawn more Slimes
[✓] Add tile-based soil patches that the player can plant corn kernels on
[✓] Make patches store a kernel value that grows over time
[✓] Allow the player to harvest grown kernels, adding them to a corn ammo variable
[✓] Limit corn ammo; the player should start with only around 50 kernels
[✓] Allow player to sell 50 kernels for 5 Bucks
[✓] Add sound effects
[✓] Add corn cob icon on a soil patch when corn is fully grown on that patch
[✓] Allow the player to be hurt by slimes and KO'd (the player has three lives, which regenerate in between waves)
[✓] Destroy the player if they don't have enough cash by the end of the night
[] Ensure game is relatively balanced by playtesting
[✓] Add warning message that pops up below corn count on the HUD, which prompts the player to harvest more corn if they attempt an action without enough corn
[✓] Add title screen
[✓] Add game over screen
[✓] Add music

Ideas for Future Expansion and Improvements
- POTENTIAL MOBILE GAME IDEA: Grow crops in a "farm" scene to use as resources, then move to an "arena" scene to fight a wave of slimes, using your grown crops as weapons!
- Allow player to execute a special "Cornado" attack with the Shift key (either LShift or RShift), which spawns ten corn kernels that are spawned around the player and fire away from them; this repeats rapidly 10 times total, so the attack costs 100 kernels to execute (After thinking about this for a while, it wouldn't be especially useful to the player, so I've decided to skip it)
- Allow player to grow different types of crops that can act as different weapons (tomato or pumpkin bombs, perhaps?)
- Special waves that can appear randomly at the beginning of the night, replacing normal waves (below is a list of Thomas's suggested Special Rounds)
-- Tax Time: The government collects 20% tax when 30 seconds are left in the wave. To suffer the least from the tax, hoard your crops until 30 seconds remain.
-- Wind Chill: Any crops planted die mere seconds after they fully grow.
-- Bunnies: Bunnies arrive with the slimes to try and eat your crops. If you accidentally kill a bunny, your reputation tanks for 5 seconds and you can't sell any crops.
-- Mole People: The Mole People have created a temporary retreat on your farm tiles. You cannot plant on the Mole People's tiles, so planting area is reduced.
-- Tiny Terror (I thought of this, not Thomas): All slimes spawned are Tiny Slimes, which appear at a rapid spawn rate.
-- Glowflies: The slimes are restless.
